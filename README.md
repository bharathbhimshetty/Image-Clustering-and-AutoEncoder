# Image-Clustering-and-Denoising using AutoEncoder

* The task is to classify images of wild animals either by clustering or by nearest vector such as pairwise distances. 
* The Task has appx 4700+ images. 
* The Image vectors are retirved based on AutoEncoder model which is designed from scratch.
* The AutoEncoder File has the architechture built for Image Denoising.
* The Clustering part-I has details about Agglomerative Clustering, Pairwise Distance retreival of given image and DBSCAN Techniques and the results are good comparitively to part-II.
* The Clustering part-II has etails about Kmeans Clustering and its techniques although the results are satisfactory.
* Also the AutoEncoder Model has been saved and uploaded for reference.
