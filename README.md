# Image-Clustering-and-Denoising using AutoEncoder

* The task is to classify images of wild animals either by clustering or by nearest vector such as pairwise distances. 
* The Task has appx 4700+ images. 
* The Image vectors are retirved based on AutoEncoder model which is designed from scratch.
* The AutoEncoder File has the architechture built for Image Denoising.
* The Clustering part-I has details about Agglomerative Clustering, Pairwise Distance retreival of given image and DBSCAN Techniques and the results are good comparitively to part-II.
* The Clustering part-II has etails about Kmeans Clustering and its techniques although the results are satisfactory.
* Also the AutoEncoder Model has been saved and uploaded for reference.
## A sample of Denoised image is shown below.

## A sample of image vectors taken from AutoEncoder and PairwiseDistance is used as metric to retrive similar images, but due to architecture design from scrath, this the best I can do.

### Image -I (Tiger is input image and similar 10 images have to be retrieved and here are the results)

### Image-II (Fox is input image and similar 10 images have to be retrieved and here are the results)
